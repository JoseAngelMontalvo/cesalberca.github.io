When backend people hear JavaScript, they shudder. When frontend people hear TypeScript, they shudder. Why can't we have the best of both worlds? This talk will heavily demistify the usage of TypeScript and we will show how can we —within a JavaScript context— apply TypeScript to get the best development experience. We'll learn what a type system has to offer us and how we can prevent up to 15% bugs in production. And did I tell you about smart autocompletion when coding? How about capturing errors in compilation time instead of runtime? Better null and undefined handling? Yes, it's possible!
