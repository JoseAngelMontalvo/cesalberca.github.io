The frontend world has always been known by its **volatile nature**, however we don't make any effort to abstract ourselves from all that. We should build **robust** and **long-lived** software. In this talk we'll see how to tackle common problems in the frontend world using **TypeScript**, **React** and several **design patterns**. We'll see how we'll make our software _open to change_ while not trying to _guess the future_. Also, we'll appreciate how following the **SOLID principles** of our app will be very easy to test and change. Are you ready for this journey on _beautiful_ software?
